# APW Nodes for ComfyUI

A custom node suite to augment the capabilities of the [AP Workflows for ComfyUI](https://perilli.com/ai/comfyui/)

## Nodes

### Image List Filter v1

This node takes an `image list` as input, filters out images smaller than either width or height, and outputs a new `image list` without the excluded images.

Example:

`<img width="412" alt="Image List Filter v1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb6d802b-413a-4e04-9252-b84174ae4769" />`

Notice: This code is based on Kijai's `Image Batch Filter`, available [here](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes/). All credit to him.
